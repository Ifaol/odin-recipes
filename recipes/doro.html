    <h2>How to prepare doro, a traditional Ethiopian food.</h2>
    <p>Doro Wet is a rich and flavorful Ethiopian stew that's perfect for spice lovers. To make this delectable dish, start by marinating chicken pieces in a mixture of lemon juice, garlic, and ginger. In a separate pan, toast a blend of spices, including fenugreek, cardamom, and cloves, to release their aromatic flavors. Then, sauté onions until they're caramelized and add berbere spice mix for that characteristic Ethiopian heat. Once the chicken is browned, simmer it with the spiced onion mixture, tomatoes, and chicken broth until the meat is tender and the sauce thickens. Serve the Doro Wet with injera, the traditional Ethiopian sourdough flatbread, for an authentic and satisfying meal.</p>

<p>Doro Wet is traditionally served during special occasions and is a beloved Ethiopian staple. The combination of the marinated chicken, robust spices, and slow cooking process creates a mouthwatering experience. The stew is meant to be spicy, so adjust the level of heat to your preference by adding or reducing the berbere spice. Don't forget to garnish it with hard-boiled eggs and extra berbere for an extra burst of flavor. Doro Wet is a dish that brings the rich culinary traditions of Ethiopia to your plate, promising a memorable and spicy adventure for your taste buds.</p>
